`MtreeRing` is a tool for automatically measuring tree-ring width using image processing techniques. The procedure of automatic detection of ring borders consists of the following stepsï¼š 

## 1. Read and plot a tree ring image

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(MtreeRing)
img.name <- system.file("001.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
```

`ring_read` supports commonly used image formats, including png, tiff, jpg and bmp.


## 2. Detect ring borders 

`ring_detect` is the most important funtion in `MtreeRing`. It is used to automatically detect tree-ring borders along the user-defined path. The automatic detection can be performed using three alternative methods: (1) watershed algorithm; (2) Canny edge detector; (3) a linear detection algorithm from R package [measuRing](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=measuRing).

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Split a long core sample into 2 pieces to
## get better display performance and use the
## watershed algorithm to detect ring borders:
t2 <- ring_detect(ring.data = t1, auto.path = TRUE, seg = 2, method = 'watershed')
```

If `auto.path = TRUE`, the function will create a path at the center of the image. In the current version, the path is a horizontal dashed line. Detected ring borders are placed along the path, and are tagged with years and border numbers.

<img src="img/single_path.png" width = 85% height = 85% />  

For increment cores with inclined rings, you can create two paths by setting `incline = TRUE`. The distance between adjacent rings and orientation of ring borders are used to correct the ring-width series.

```{r eval=FALSE}
img.name <- system.file("incline.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
t2 <- ring_detect(ring.data = t1, incline = TRUE, method = 'watershed')
```

<img src="img/two_paths.png" width = 85% height = 85% />

## 3. Edit tree rings

You can manually add (remove) tree ring borders to (from) the image using the function `ring_modify`.

### 3.1 Remove tree rings

Assume that ring borders numbered from 1 to 4 were falsely identified as transitions between earlywood and latewood. Try to remove them with the following commands.

```{r eval=FALSE}
img.name <- system.file("001.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
t2 <- ring_detect(ring.data = t1, auto.path = TRUE, method = 'watershed')
t2 <- ring_modify(ring.data = t2, del = c(1:4))
```

### 3.2 Add tree rings

We have just removed 4 ring borders, now re-add these borders by left-clicking on the image. See function's help for more details about mouse clicks.

```{r eval=FALSE}
t2 <- ring_modify(ring.data = t2, add = TRUE)
```

## 4. Calculate ring-width series 

If all ring borders are correctly identified, you can generate a ring-width series in data frame format. Use `write.rwl` to export the ring-width series to an rwl file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rw.df <- ring_calculate(ring.data = t2, seriesID = "940220")
library(dplR) # A dendrochronological analysis package
fn <- tempfile(fileext=".rwl")
write.rwl(rwl.df = rw.df, fname = fn, format = "tucson")
```
