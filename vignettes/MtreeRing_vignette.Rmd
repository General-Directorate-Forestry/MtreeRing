`MtreeRing` is a tool for automatically measuring tree-ring width using image processing techniques.

## 1. Read and plot a tree ring image

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(MtreeRing)
img.name <- system.file("001.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
```

`ring_read` supports commonly used image formats, including png, tiff, jpg and bmp.


## 2. Detect ring borders 

`ring_detect` is the most important funtion in `MtreeRing`. It is used to automatically detect tree-ring borders along the user-defined path. The automatic detection can be performed using three alternative methods: (1) watershed algorithm; (2) Canny edge detector; (3) a linear detection algorithm from R package [measuRing](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=measuRing).

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Split a long core sample into 2 pieces to
## get better display performance and use the
## watershed algorithm to detect ring borders:
t2 <- ring_detect(ring.data = t1, auto.path = TRUE, seg = 2, method = 'watershed')
```

If `auto.path = TRUE`, the function will create a path at the center of the image. In the current version, the path is a horizontal dashed line. Detected ring borders are placed along the path, and are tagged with years and border numbers.

For increment cores with inclined rings, you can create two paths by setting `incline = TRUE`. The distance between adjacent rings and orientation of ring borders are used to correct the ring-width series.

```{r eval=FALSE}
img.name <- system.file("incline.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
t2 <- ring_detect(ring.data = t1, incline = TRUE, method = 'watershed')
```

## 3. Edit tree rings

You can manually add (remove) tree ring borders to (from) the image using the function `ring_modify`.

### 3.1 Remove tree rings

Assume that ring borders numbered from 1 to 4 were falsely identified as transitions between earlywood and latewood. Try to remove them with the following commands.

```{r eval=FALSE}
img.name <- system.file("001.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
t2 <- ring_detect(ring.data = t1, auto.path = TRUE, method = 'watershed')
t2 <- ring_modify(ring.data = t2, del = c(1:4))
```

### 3.2 Add tree rings

We have just removed 4 ring borders, now re-add these borders by left-clicking on the image. See function's help for more details about mouse clicks.

```{r eval=FALSE}
t2 <- ring_modify(ring.data = t2, add = TRUE)
```

## 4. Calculate ring-width series 

If all ring borders are correctly identified, you can generate a ring-width series in data frame format. Use `write.rwl` to export the ring-width series to an rwl file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rw.df <- ring_calculate(ring.data = t2, seriesID = "940220")
library(dplR) # A dendrochronological analysis package
fn <- tempfile(fileext=".rwl")
write.rwl(rwl.df = rw.df, fname = fn, format = "tucson")
```

## 5. Measure tree rings near the pith

It is common for increment cores to miss the pith. For wood samples with missing pith, the function `pith_measure` is used to measure tree rings on the pith side. See function's help for more details.

```{r eval=FALSE}
img.name <- system.file("arc.png", package = "MtreeRing")
t1 <- ring_read(img = img.name, dpi = 1200)
# Assume that the wood sample misses the pith
t2 <- pith_measure(ring.data = t1, inner.arc = TRUE, last.yr = 2016)
```

## 6. Run Shiny app

If you are not familiar with R and its command line interface, the shiny-based app is a good alternative. 

A workflow for the Shiny app can be found in the README file of this package. Most steps are demonstrated with a gif to make the workflow more understandable. Here is a link: https://github.com/JingningShi/MtreeRing.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ring_app_launch()
```
